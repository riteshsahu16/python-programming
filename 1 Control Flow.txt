1. Conditionals
if <condition>:
elif <condition>:
else:
	-----

eg> Max of two:
a = int(input())
b = int(input())

if a>b:
	print(a)
elif b>a:
	print(b)
else:
	print("a==b")

Ternary Operator/Short-hand if-else
res = "a" if a>b else "b" if b>a else "a==b"

2. Looping 

while-loop:

while <condition>:
	.........
else:
	pass


for-loop:

for i in <iterable>:
	...........
else:
	pass

*In python you can use else block also.
else block : when the loop terminates normally, the else block is executed.
		when loop terminates due to jump statement, the else block is NOT executed.

*Don't get confuse with other language such a C/C++
 scoping rules does not apply in looping due to absence of block

3. break & continue
	break : jump out of current loop	
	continue : jump to next iteration

4. pass : 	
		-does nothing
		-supports empty block from getting error

5. range(start, end, steps) : 
	- returns iterable object.
	- can be give 3 arg. : start - including the start index
			       end - excludes end index, goes upto end-1

				steps: how many positions to jump & in which direction

6. in 
7. del
8. None
9. List Cloning
10. is


Membership:  x in [dfdsdf]
is - keyword

l = [1,2,3,4,5]
m = [1,2,3,4,5]
a = l	a will point to same object in memory 

a == l	-> True
a is l	-> True
l == m	-> True
l is m 	-> False

prime_list = [ ]

if x in prime_list:
	return x
